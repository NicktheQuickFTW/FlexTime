# HELiiX FlexTime FAQ
## Comprehensive Stakeholder Q&A

---

## General Questions

### Q: What exactly is FlexTime?
**A:** FlexTime is an AI-powered scheduling platform that uses conversational AI and machine learning to create, optimize, and manage sports schedules. Think of it as having a scheduling expert available 24/7 who knows every rule, constraint, and preference - but powered by AI that can process millions of possibilities in seconds.

### Q: How is this different from our current scheduling software?
**A:** Current tools are databases with rules - you input data and get basic outputs. FlexTime understands natural language ("Find the best dates for our rivalry games"), learns from every decision, predicts conflicts before they happen, and continuously optimizes schedules. It's like upgrading from a calculator to a financial advisor.

### Q: Why do we need AI for scheduling?
**A:** The Big 12 manages 16 universities, 20+ sports, 300+ annual competitions across 4 time zones. The complexity is exponential - billions of possible combinations. AI can evaluate all options instantly, spot patterns humans miss, and optimize for multiple goals simultaneously (revenue, fairness, travel, etc.).

### Q: What happens if the AI makes a mistake?
**A:** Multiple safeguards exist:
- Human approval required for all schedules
- AI explains its reasoning for transparency
- Override any AI recommendation
- Rollback changes instantly
- Traditional manual backup always available

### Q: Do we need technical expertise to use it?
**A:** No. FlexTime uses conversational AI - you literally talk to it in plain English. No coding, no complex interfaces. If you can send a text message, you can use FlexTime.
