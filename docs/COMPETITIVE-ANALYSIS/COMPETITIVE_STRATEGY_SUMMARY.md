## Market Position Statement

**FlexTime: Professional-grade sports scheduling with next-generation design, built for modern athletic departments**

## The Competitive Landscape

### Market Segments

## The Bottom Line

FlexTime doesn't need to beat FastBreak at their own game. We need to:

1. **Own the mid-market** with better design and fair pricing

3. **Solve real problems** like academic calendar integration
4. **Build trust** through transparency and great support
5. **Move fast** while competitors protect legacy systems

The sports scheduling market is ready for disruption. FastBreak owns the top, youth sports tools own the bottom, but the middle - where most athletic departments live - is underserved. That's where FlexTime wins.

**Our Mission**: Make championship scheduling accessible to every athletic department, not just the elite.

**Our Vision**: Become the obvious choice for any organization that needs professional scheduling without enterprise complexity.

**Our Strategy**: Better design, better pricing, better fit for the 95% of sports organizations FastBreak ignores.
