# FlexTime Documentation

## Documentation Structure

FlexTime follows a hybrid documentation approach:

1. **Core Documentation** (this directory)
   - [FlexTime Playbook](FlexTime_Playbook.md) - Comprehensive implementation guide
   - [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) - Developer and AI agent guidance
   - [AI_README.md](AI_README.md) - AI agent instructions

2. **Domain-Specific Documentation**
   - Component-specific documentation is located alongside the code it describes
   - Example: `/backend/src/constraints/v2/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

3. **Implementation Plans**
   - Completed implementation plans are archived in `/completed-plans/`
   - Current implementation documents are kept with their respective components

4. **Development Documentation**
   - Development roadmap: `/development/development_roadmap.md`
   - Architecture overviews: `/development/infrastructure-enhancement/docs/`

## Key Resources

- **Migration Integration Plan**: `/backend/docs/MIGRATION_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`
- **Constraint System Analysis**: `/analysis/CONSTRAINT_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS_AND_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
- **HELiiX Intelligence Engine Status**: `/backend/src/ai/intelligence_engine/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`
- **Event Infrastructure**: `/migration/event-infrastructure/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

## Documentation Standards

- Use Markdown for all documentation
- Include links to related documents when relevant
- Keep component-specific implementation details with their code
- Update the FlexTime Playbook when making significant architectural changes
