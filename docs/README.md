# FlexTime Documentation

This directory contains all documentation for the FlexTime project.

## Structure

- `docs/` (root): Contains project-level documentation including main README and architecture overview
- `docs/backend/`: Contains backend-specific documentation
  - API specifications
  - Database setup
  - System architecture
  - Learning systems

## Documentation Consolidation

Previously, documentation was scattered across:
- Repository root (README.md and others)
- `backend/docs/`
- Various subdirectories

This centralized approach makes it easier to find and maintain documentation.
