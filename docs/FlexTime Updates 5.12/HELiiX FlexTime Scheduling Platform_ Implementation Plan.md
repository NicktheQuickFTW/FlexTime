### 2. Implementation Phases and Timeline

The project will be executed in several phases, allowing for iterative development, testing, and feedback. Given the deadline of August 2025 (approximately 15 months from May 2025), the timeline needs to be aggressive yet realistic.

**Phase 0: Project Setup & Detailed Planning (May 2025 - June 2025) - 2 Months**

-   **Activities**:
    -   Finalize project team and roles.
    -   Set up development, testing, and staging environments (including Neon DB, Node.js, Python, React environments).
    -   Establish CI/CD pipeline basics.
    -   Detailed task breakdown and sprint planning for Phase 1.
    -   Refine UI/UX mockups based on the black and white Big 12 theme.
    -   Confirm API contracts between frontend and backend services.
    -   Procure any necessary licenses or cloud resources.
-   **Deliverables**:

    -   Environment Setup Confirmation.
    -   Finalized UI/UX mockups (black and white theme).
    -   Initial API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger stubs).

**Phase 1: Core Platform Development & MVP (July 2025 - December 2025) - 6 Months**

-   **Focus**: Develop the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with core scheduling functionalities for a primary sport (e.g., Football or Basketball).
-   **Backend Activities**:
    -   Develop Data Management Service (CRUD APIs for core entities: Teams, Venues, Users, Basic Schedules, Constraints).
    -   Develop initial Scheduling Service (basic constraint handling, manual schedule creation support).
    -   Develop basic Agent Management Service.
    -   Set up API Gateway with authentication/authorization.
    -   Implement core database schema in Neon DB.
-   **Frontend Activities**:
    -   Develop User Management Module (login, user roles).
    -   Develop Team and Venue Management Module.
    -   Develop basic Schedule Management Module (grid view for manual input, list view).
    -   Develop basic Constraint Configuration Module (defining hard constraints).
-   **MAS Activities**:
    -   Develop foundational structures for Director and basic Specialized Agents (e.g., Constraint Management Agent - basic rule checking).
-   **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests for core components.
-   **Deliverables**:
    -   MVP of the platform with core scheduling for one sport.
    -   Deployed backend services (core) and frontend application to staging.
    -   Documentation for MVP features and APIs.
    -   Initial test reports.

**Phase 2: Advanced Scheduling & ML Integration (January 2026 - June 2026) - 6 Months**

*(Note: This phase extends beyond the August 2025 deadline based on typical development cycles for such complexity. The plan needs to highlight what can be achieved by Aug 2025 and what would be subsequent enhancements, or if scope/resources need adjustment for the Aug 2025 deadline to include these features.)*

**Adjusted Phase 2 for August 2025 Target (January 2025 - May 2025) - 5 Months (assuming current date is May 2024, if May 2025, then this is very tight)**

*Re-evaluating based on current date May 10, 2025, and August 2025 deadline (3.5 months remaining from start of this phase if it began in May 2025). This is extremely aggressive. The following assumes a re-prioritization for what is feasible by Aug 2025.* 

**Revised Phase 2: Core Optimization & Essential Features (May 2025 - July 2025) - 3 Months (Parallel with end of Phase 0 & start of Phase 1 if possible, or this is the main focus after Phase 0)**

-   **Focus**: Implement core optimization capabilities and essential intelligent features for the MVP sport.
-   **Backend Activities**:
    -   Develop Optimization Service (integrate one primary optimization algorithm, e.g., ILP for basic travel/conflict minimization).
    -   Enhance Scheduling Service to use the Optimization Service.
    -   Develop initial ML Service: Basic COMPASS Index components (e.g., team strength input, not full prediction).
    -   Develop RAG Agent for NLQ (basic functionality with limited dataset).
-   **Frontend Activities**:
    -   Enhance Schedule Management Module to display optimized schedule suggestions.
    -   Develop basic Reporting and Analytics Module (e.g., travel distance display).
    -   Integrate NLQ interface.
-   **MAS Activities**:
    -   Enhance Constraint Management Agent to interact with Optimization Service.
    -   Develop basic Travel Optimization Agent.
-   **Testing**: Testing of optimization results, NLQ accuracy.
-   **Deliverables**:
    -   MVP with basic automated scheduling optimization for one sport.
    -   NLQ feature (beta).
    -   Updated documentation and test reports.

**Phase 3: Multi-Sport Expansion, Advanced ML, & UI Polish (Post-August 2025 or highly prioritized subset for Aug 2025)**

*Given August 2025 deadline, this phase will be significantly curtailed or moved post-deadline. For August 2025, focus will be on stabilizing and delivering what's built in revised Phase 2.*

**Revised Phase 3: Testing, Refinement, and Delivery (August 2025) - 1 Month**

-   **Focus**: Rigorous testing, bug fixing, performance tuning, documentation finalization, and user acceptance testing (UAT) for the features developed by end of July 2025.
-   **Activities**:
    -   End-to-end system testing.
    -   Performance and load testing.
    -   Security testing.
    -   UAT with Big 12 stakeholders.
    -   Address feedback from UAT.
    -   Finalize all user and technical documentation.
    -   Prepare for production deployment.
-   **Deliverables**:
    -   Fully tested and UAT-approved platform (scope as per revised Phase 2).
    -   Complete System Documentation (User Manual, Admin Guide, API Docs, Design Docs).
    -   Deployment package and runbooks.
    -   Training materials for Big 12 staff.

### 3. Resource Allocation

-   **Development Team**: Requires a mix of frontend (React), backend (Node.js, Python), ML engineers, DevOps engineers, and QA specialists.
