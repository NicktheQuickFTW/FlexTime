## HELiiX FlexTime Scheduling Platform: System Architecture Needs

This document outlines the system architecture needs for the HELiiX FlexTime Scheduling Platform, derived from the synthesized requirements and incorporating Big 12 Conference specific guidelines.

### 1. Architectural Goals

The system architecture must support the following primary goals:

-   **Scalability**: The platform must handle a growing number of sports, teams, constraints, and users without performance degradation.
-   **Performance**: Achieve fast schedule generation, optimization, and data retrieval. This includes quick convergence times for algorithms and low latency for user interactions.
-   **Modularity**: Design components that are loosely coupled and independently deployable/updatable to facilitate easier maintenance and phased development.
-   **Extensibility**: The architecture should allow for the addition of new features, sports, and ML models with minimal impact on existing components.
-   **Reliability & Availability**: Ensure high uptime and data integrity, particularly for critical scheduling and data storage functions.
-   **Security**: Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data and control access to platform functionalities.
-   **Maintainability**: Codebase and infrastructure should be well-documented and easy to manage and update.
-   **Adherence to Big 12 Standards**: Comply with Big 12 project timeline (deliverables by August 2025), deliverable formats (documents preferred), and visual design preferences (black and white color scheme).

### 2. Proposed System Architecture: Multi-Tier & Microservices-Oriented

A multi-tier architecture combined with microservices principles for key components is recommended to meet the outlined goals.

#### 2.1. Presentation Tier (Frontend)

-   **Technology**: React-based Single Page Application (SPA).
-   **Key Features**:
    -   Interactive scheduling matrix (drag-and-drop), calendar, and list views.
    -   Constraint management dashboard.
    -   Real-time metrics visualization.
    -   Administrative controls and user management.
    -   Schedule export functionality.
    -   Natural Language Query (NLQ) interface for the RAG agent.
-   **Design**: Adhere to Big 12 black and white color scheme. Ensure responsive design for future mobile-first accessibility.

#### 2.2. Application Tier (Backend)

This tier will host the core business logic and API services. A microservices-based approach is suitable for different functional domains.

-   **Technology**: Node.js for API services. Python for ML and optimization services.
-   **Core Services (Microservices)**:
    -   **Scheduling Service**: Manages the core scheduling engine, including constraint-based optimization, multi-sport support, and championship-first logic. This service will house the sport-specific optimizers.
    -   **Optimization Service**: Contains various optimization algorithms (e.g., ILP, genetic algorithms, meta-heuristics). This service will be called by the Scheduling Service.
    -   **Machine Learning Service**: Hosts the ML models (COMPASS Index, predictive analytics, pattern extraction) and manages the ML workflow (data collection, training, validation). Includes the RAG agent for NLQ.
    -   **Data Management Service**: Provides APIs for accessing and managing data related to teams, venues, historical schedules, user data, etc.
    -   **Agent Management Service**: Manages the lifecycle and communication of the multi-agent system (Director and Specialized Agents).
    -   **Notification Service**: Handles real-time updates and notifications to users (e.g., schedule changes, conflicts).
    -   **API Gateway**: A single entry point for all frontend requests, routing them to the appropriate backend services. Handles authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.

#### 2.3. Data Tier

-   **Primary Database**: Neon DB (PostgreSQL-compatible).
    -   Stores structured business data (teams, venues, schedules, constraints, user accounts).
    -   Manages agent memories and learning data.
    -   Stores training data and feedback for ML models.
-   **Caching Layer**: Redis (optional, but recommended for performance).
    -   Caches frequently accessed data to reduce database load and improve response times.
    -   Can be used for short-term agent memory.
-   **Data Lake/Warehouse (Future Consideration)**: For storing large volumes of historical data for advanced analytics and ML model retraining, if needed beyond Neon DB capabilities.

#### 2.4. Multi-Agent System (MAS) Integration

-   The MAS will be a core component integrated within the Application Tier, likely managed by the Agent Management Service.
-   **Director Agents** (e.g., Scheduling Director, Operations Director, Analysis Director) will orchestrate workflows and delegate tasks.
-   **Specialized Agents** (e.g., Algorithm Selection, Constraint Management, Travel Optimization, Resource Allocation) will perform specific tasks, interacting with relevant microservices (e.g., Scheduling Service, Optimization Service).

### 3. Technology Stack Summary

-   **Frontend**: React, HTML5, CSS3 (with black and white theme).
-   **Backend APIs**: Node.js (Express.js or similar framework).
-   **ML/Optimization**: Python (libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, PuLP/OR-Tools).
-   **Database**: Neon DB (PostgreSQL).
-   **Caching**: Redis.
-   **Messaging/Queuing (for inter-service communication)**: RabbitMQ or Kafka (if asynchronous communication becomes critical).
-   **Containerization & Orchestration**: Docker, Kubernetes (for scalability and deployment management).
-   **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.

### 4. Key Architectural Considerations

-   **API Design**: RESTful APIs with clear versioning and comprehensive documentation (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger).
-   **Asynchronous Operations**: For long-running tasks like schedule generation or ML model training, use asynchronous patterns (e.g., message queues, background workers) to avoid blocking user interactions.
-   **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration for all services and environments.
-   **Logging and Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring across all tiers and services to facilitate debugging, performance analysis, and operational oversight.
-   **Data Flow**: Clearly defined data flow between services, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

### 5. Adherence to Big 12 Timelines and Deliverables

-   The architecture should allow for phased development and delivery to meet the August 2025 deadline.
-   Key deliverables will be documentation (system architecture document, API documentation, design documents), aligning with Big 12 preferences.

This architecture provides a foundation for building a scalable, intelligent, and future-proof scheduling platform that meets the complex requirements of the Big 12 Conference and the HELiiX FlexTime vision.
