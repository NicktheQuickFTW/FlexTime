## HELiiX FlexTime Scheduling Platform: Synthesized Requirements

This document outlines the synthesized requirements for the HELiiX FlexTime Scheduling Platform, based on the provided documentation and strategic intelligence prompt. The goal is to evolve the platform into a future-proof, intelligent, multi-sport scheduling system that surpasses existing benchmarks.

### 1. Core Scheduling Engine Capabilities

The platform must possess a robust scheduling engine capable of handling complex constraints and optimization goals across multiple sports.

-   **Constraint-Based Optimization**: The system must effectively manage and optimize schedules based on a wide array of constraints. These include, but are not limited to, NCAA bylaws, Big 12 conference rules, individual team preferences, venue availability, travel limitations, and rest day requirements. The engine should be flexible enough to adapt to new or modified constraints.
-   **Multi-Sport Support**: The platform needs to support scheduling for various collegiate sports, incorporating sport-specific rules, formats, and nuances. This includes dedicated optimizers and logic tailored to the unique characteristics of each sport (e.g., football, basketball, Olympic sports).
-   **Championship-First Scheduling**: A key design principle is to prioritize and integrate championship schedules. This involves direct synchronization with NCAA tournament dates and brackets. The system should employ tournament-aware algorithms that back-propagate postseason considerations into the regular-season scheduling process to maximize postseason opportunities.
-   **Travel Optimization**: Minimizing travel time, costs, and logistical burdens is a critical requirement. The system should incorporate sophisticated travel optimization algorithms that consider distances, modes of transport, and travel clusters.
-   **Venue and Resource Allocation**: Efficient management of venue availability and other necessary resources is essential. The platform must be able to allocate resources optimally, avoiding conflicts and ensuring fair distribution.
-   **Rest Day Management**: The system must enforce rules regarding minimum rest days between games and optimize their distribution to ensure player welfare and competitive balance.

### 2. Intelligence and Machine Learning Integration

The platform will leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence to provide advanced scheduling capabilities and continuous improvement.

-   **Self-Learning System**: FlexTime should incorporate a continuous feedback loop, allowing the ML engine to learn from user inputs, historical data, and schedule performance. This self-correction mechanism aims to improve schedule quality and reduce manual adjustments over time.
-   **Predictive Analytics**: The system must feature a predictive analytics component, such as an evolved COMPASS Index. This will provide insights into team performance, predict game outcomes, assess strength of schedule (SoS), and measure potential injury impacts. These predictions will inform the scheduling process.
-   **Dynamic KPI-Driven Logic**: Scheduling logic should be driven by Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that can be dynamically adjusted. This allows the system to adapt to changing strategic priorities and conference goals.
-   **Pattern Extraction and Knowledge Building**: The ML workflow should include capabilities for extracting meaningful patterns from historical scheduling data and converting these patterns into actionable knowledge for the scheduling agents.
-   **Scenario Modeling**: The platform must support scenario modeling, allowing administrators to explore different scheduling options categorized by feasibility (meets hard constraints), playability (satisfies soft constraints), and optimality (minimizes penalties across all constraints).

### 3. System Architecture and Technology Stack

The underlying architecture must be robust, scalable, and utilize modern technologies.

-   **Multi-Agent System (MAS)**: A hierarchical multi-agent architecture is required. This will consist of director agents overseeing broad tasks (e.g., Scheduling Director, Operations Director, Analysis Director) and specialized agents focused on specific functions (e.g., Algorithm Selection, Constraint Management, Travel Optimization, Resource Allocation).
-   **Scalability and Performance**: The system must be designed for high performance, including fast convergence times for optimization algorithms, efficient memory usage, and support for parallelization to handle large-scale scheduling problems effectively.
-   **Technology Stack**: The backend will be developed using Node.js, providing RESTful API endpoints for frontend and external integrations. The frontend will be a React-based application, offering an interactive user experience. The primary database will be Neon DB (PostgreSQL-compatible), with Redis potentially used for caching to enhance performance.

### 4. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)

The platform must provide an intuitive and powerful user interface for managing and visualizing schedules.

-   **Interactive Scheduling Tools**: The UI should feature interactive tools such as a drag-and-drop schedule matrix, calendar views, and list views to facilitate easy schedule manipulation and visualization.
-   **Constraint Dashboard**: A dedicated dashboard is needed to display active constraints, explain scheduling conflicts in plain language, and potentially suggest resolutions or allow users to provide input on constraint priorities.
-   **Real-Time Metrics Visualization**: The system should provide real-time visualization of key scheduling metrics, such as travel miles, rest days, TV window fulfillment, and rivalry game placement, often using color-coding for clarity.
-   **Natural Language Querying (RAG Agent)**: A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) agent should allow users to query school-specific data and scheduling information using natural language (e.g., "How many Thursday road games did OSU have last year?").
-   **Mobile-First Accessibility**: A future development goal is to ensure the platform is optimized for mobile devices, providing accessibility for administrators on the go.

### 5. Strategic Enhancements and Future-Proofing

To ensure long-term success and competitive advantage, the platform must incorporate the following strategic enhancements:

-   **Competitive Superiority**: The evolved FlexTime platform aims to surpass existing scheduling systems like Faktor, KPI Sports, and Fastbreak AI in terms of features, intelligence, and efficiency.
-   **Continuous Innovation**: The development roadmap should focus on generating breakthrough ideas and intelligent features that will remain relevant and vital for the next decade and beyond. This includes exploring concepts like real-time multi-agent rebalancing and hyper-personalization for each sport and team.
-   **Postseason Maximization Strategies**: The system must actively work to enhance NCAA postseason opportunities for conference teams. This involves developing logic to balance hard and soft constraints while subtly optimizing factors like Strength of Schedule, competitive equity, and other team selection metrics.
-   **Broadcast Window Optimization**: Integration of algorithms to optimize schedules for television broadcast windows is a key future enhancement, maximizing media exposure and revenue opportunities.
-   **Evolved KPI and Metric System**: The platform should develop and track an advanced set of KPIs and metrics (e.g., an evolution of the COMPASS index, an AI-composite schedule balance index) to measure schedule quality and strategic alignment comprehensively.
-   **"Unthinkable but Genius" Innovations**: The project encourages the exploration of novel, potentially disruptive ideas that could provide a significant competitive edge in sports scheduling.

This comprehensive set of requirements will guide the design and development of the next-generation HELiiX FlexTime Scheduling Platform.
