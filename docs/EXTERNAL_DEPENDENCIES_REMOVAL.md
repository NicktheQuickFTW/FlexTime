# External Dependencies Removal

This document provides an overview of the changes made to remove external service dependencies from the FlexTime application, making it fully self-contained and independent.

## Overview

FlexTime previously relied on several external services for advanced functionality:

1. **Intelligence Engine** - An external service for enhanced scheduling capabilities
2. **Context7** - A documentation and pattern recognition service
3. **ElevenLabs** - A voice assistant provider

These external dependencies have been removed and their functionality integrated directly into the FlexTime application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Intelligence Engine Replacement

The external Intelligence Engine (expected on localhost:4001) has been replaced with an integrated service:

- Created `AdvancedSchedulingService` to provide all critical functionality locally
- Implemented a client adapter for backward compatibility
- Integrated historical learning directly into the service
- Updated all code that previously depended on the Intelligence Engine

### 2. Context7 Elimination

All Context7 dependencies were removed:

- Replaced `useContext7` hook with a new `useFlexApp` hook
- Created integrated endpoints for library info, documentation, and recommendations
- Updated UI components to use the new integrated services
- Removed all Context7 API calls from the codebase

### 3. Virtual Assistant Integration

The ElevenLabs-based virtual assistant was replaced with a local implementation:

- Replaced `ElevenLabsAssistant` with `FlexAssistant`
- Created a local virtual assistant service for conversation handling
- Implemented all assistant capabilities directly in the application
- Removed external API dependencies

### 4. UI Component Refactoring

UI components were updated to work with the integrated services:

- Moved c7 components to appropriate locations with proper naming
- Updated all imports and dependencies
- Created new analytics dashboards that work without external services
- Maintained backward compatibility for existing code

## New Components

### 1. Advanced Scheduling Service

File: `/services/advanced_scheduling_service.js`

This service provides:
- Historical data storage and analysis
- Schedule optimization
- Pattern recognition
- Learning from feedback
- Recommendation generation

### 2. FlexApp Hook

File: `/hooks/useFlexApp.js`

This hook provides:
- Centralized access to all FlexTime services
- Context management for application state
- Former Context7 capabilities
- Scheduling service integration

### 3. Virtual Assistant Service

File: `/services/virtualAssistantService.js`

This service provides:
- Conversation management
- Pattern detection
- Documentation access
- Recommendation generation

## API Changes

New API endpoints have been added:

### Scheduling Service API

- `GET /api/scheduling-service/status`
- `POST /api/scheduling-service/recommendations`
- `GET /api/scheduling-service/sports/:sportType/templates`
- `GET /api/scheduling-service/learning/insights`
- `POST /api/scheduling-service/optimize`
- `POST /api/scheduling-service/feedback`
- `POST /api/scheduling-service/store`

### Virtual Assistant API

- `GET /api/virtual-assistant/status`
- `POST /api/virtual-assistant/resolve-library-id`
- `POST /api/virtual-assistant/get-library-docs`
- `POST /api/virtual-assistant/detect-patterns`
- `POST /api/virtual-assistant/generate-recommendations`
- `GET /api/virtual-assistant/voices`
- `GET /api/virtual-assistant/models`
- `POST /api/virtual-assistant/conversations`
- `POST /api/virtual-assistant/conversations/:conversationId/messages`
- `POST /api/virtual-assistant/conversations/:conversationId/end`

## Environment Configuration

The following environment variables are no longer used:

```
INTELLIGENCE_ENGINE_URL
INTELLIGENCE_ENGINE_API_KEY
ENABLE_INTELLIGENCE_ENGINE
CONTEXT7_API_URL
CONTEXT7_API_KEY
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY
```

Instead, the application now uses:

```
# Optional configuration for scheduling service
SCHEDULING_SERVICE_MEMORY_DIR=/path/to/data

# Optional configuration for virtual assistant
ASSISTANT_DATA_DIR=/path/to/assistant/data
```

## Benefits of the Changes

1. **Simplified Architecture**: No external dependencies to manage
2. **Improved Reliability**: No network failures or external service outages
3. **Enhanced Security**: All data stays within the application
4. **Easier Deployment**: Only need to deploy a single application
5. **Better Performance**: No network latency for service calls
6. **Offline Operation**: Works without external connectivity

## Next Steps

Future improvements could include:

1. Further integration of machine learning models directly into the application
2. Adding more visualization components for analytics
3. Expanding the virtual assistant capabilities
4. Implementing additional optimization algorithms
