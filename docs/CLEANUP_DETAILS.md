# Detailed Project Cleanup Report

This document outlines the detailed cleanup actions performed on the FlexTime codebase to improve organization, remove legacy components, and standardize implementations.

## 1. Context7 MCP Removal

Previously, the project used Context7 as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) provider, but this approach was superseded by more direct integrations with AI model providers. The following files were removed:

- `backend/agents/enhanced/c7_*.js` files (pattern detection, adaptive learning, etc.)
- `backend/utils/context7_client.js`
- `backend/dist/c7/` UI components
- MCP coordination and configuration related files

## 2. MongoDB to Neon DB Migration

The database layer was migrated from MongoDB to Neon DB, but some legacy MongoDB references remained:

- Removed `mongoose` dependency from package.json
- Updated `agent_memory_manager.js` to use Neon DB instead of MongoDB 
- Removed `agent_memory_persistence.js` which used Mongoose schemas
- Updated the agent factory to use the Enhanced Memory Manager with Neon DB

## 3. Directory Structure Improvements

### Test Directories

Multiple test directories were consolidated into a single structure:
- `test/` - Main test directory
- `test/data/` - Test data files
- `test/results/` - Test output
- `test/integration-tests/` - Integration tests
- `test/unit-tests/` - Unit tests

Removed redundant directories:
- `tests/`
- `testing/`

### Client Directories

Clarified purpose by renaming:
- `client/` → `ui-components/` (React UI components)
- `clients/` → `api-clients/` (External API clients)

### Documentation

Consolidated documentation into a central structure:
- `/docs/` - Main documentation
- `/docs/backend/` - Backend-specific documentation

## 4. Code Modernization

### MCP Connector

Standardized on the newer v2 connector:
- Replaced `mcp_connector.js` with the more advanced implementation from `mcp_connector_v2.js`
- Updated all imports to use the improved connector

### Database Models

Updated to newer model versions:
- Replaced `db-schedule.js` with `db-schedule-updated.js`
- Replaced `db-team.js` with `db-team-updated.js`
- These updates support the season_id field instead of championship_id

## 5. Removed Files

- `backend/agents/index.js.bak`
- Outdated model files (`*.bak`)
- Duplicated UI components
- Multiple test directories
- MongoDB-specific memory persistence mechanisms

## 6. Updated Configurations

- Removed `build:c7` script from package.json
- Updated agent factory to use enhanced memory manager
- Updated database connection strings to point to Neon DB

## 7. Documentation

Added README files to explain directory structure changes:
- `backend/test/README.md`
- `backend/ui-components/README.md`
- `backend/api-clients/README.md`
- `backend/learning/README.md`
- `docs/README.md`
