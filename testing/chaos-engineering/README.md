# Chaos Engineering Suite

This directory contains chaos engineering tools and experiments designed to proactively discover system weaknesses and improve resilience in the Flextime scheduling system.

## Philosophy

Chaos Engineering is the practice of experimenting on a system to build confidence in the system's capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production. We intentionally inject failures to:

- **Discover Hidden Dependencies**: Uncover dependencies that aren't immediately obvious
- **Test Recovery Procedures**: Validate that systems recover gracefully from failures
- **Improve Reliability**: Build more resilient systems through controlled failure testing
- **Validate Monitoring**: Ensure monitoring and alerting systems detect issues properly
- **Build Confidence**: Increase confidence in system behavior during outages

## Chaos Engineering Principles

1. **Start with a Hypothesis**: Define what you expect to happen during the experiment
2. **Vary Real-world Events**: Simulate realistic failure scenarios
3. **Run Experiments in Production**: Test in environments that matter (with safety measures)
4. **Automate Experiments**: Make chaos engineering part of regular operations
5. **Minimize Blast Radius**: Limit the impact of experiments to prevent widespread damage

## Experiment Categories

### Infrastructure Chaos
- **network-partitioning.js**: Network connectivity failures between services
- **service-unavailability.js**: Random service outages and dependencies
- **resource-exhaustion.js**: CPU, memory, and disk resource limitations
- **latency-injection.js**: Network latency and timeout scenarios

### Application Chaos
- **database-failures.js**: Database connection and query failures
- **api-chaos.js**: HTTP errors, timeouts, and malformed responses
- **dependency-failures.js**: Third-party service unavailability
- **data-corruption.js**: Invalid data and state corruption scenarios

### Configuration Chaos
- **environment-variables.js**: Missing or incorrect configuration
- **feature-flag-chaos.js**: Feature flag state changes
- **scaling-events.js**: Auto-scaling and load balancing failures

### Time-based Chaos
- **clock-skew.js**: System time synchronization issues
- **timezone-chaos.js**: Timezone handling edge cases
- **schedule-timing.js**: Time-sensitive scheduling operation failures

## Safety Mechanisms

### Blast Radius Limiting
- Experiments run in isolated environments first
- Gradual rollout to production with safety checks
- Automatic experiment termination on critical failures
- Circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures

### Monitoring Integration
- Real-time monitoring during experiments
- Automated rollback triggers
- Alerting integration for experiment status
- Performance impact measurement

### Recovery Validation
- Automated recovery verification
- System health checks post-experiment
- Data integrity validation
- Performance regression detection

## Chaos Monkey Integration

Implementation of Netflix's Chaos Monkey principles:
- Random instance termination
- Service degradation simulation
- Dependency failure injection
- Automated failure scenarios

## Experiment Execution

### Pre-experiment Checklist
1. Define clear hypothesis and success criteria
2. Ensure monitoring and alerting is functional
3. Verify rollback procedures are tested
4. Confirm experiment scope and blast radius
5. Notify relevant teams about planned experiments

### During Experiments
1. Monitor system behavior continuously
2. Document observed behaviors
3. Be ready to abort if unexpected issues arise
4. Validate that monitoring detects the chaos

### Post-experiment Analysis
1. Compare results against hypothesis
2. Document lessons learned
3. Identify system improvements needed
4. Update runbooks and procedures
5. Share findings with team
