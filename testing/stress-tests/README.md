# Stress Testing Suite

This directory contains comprehensive stress testing scenarios designed to identify system breaking points and failure modes for the Flextime scheduling system.

## Testing Philosophy

Stress testing pushes the system beyond normal operating capacity to identify:
- Resource exhaustion points
- Memory leaks and performance degradation
- Cascading failure scenarios
- Recovery and resilience characteristics
- Data consistency under extreme load

## Test Categories

### Resource Exhaustion Tests
- **memory-exhaustion.js**: Memory consumption stress testing
- **cpu-saturation.js**: CPU-intensive workload testing
- **database-connection-exhaustion.js**: Database connection pool limits
- **file-descriptor-limits.js**: System resource limits testing

### Load Escalation Tests
- **gradual-load-increase.js**: Slowly increasing load until failure
- **breaking-point-analysis.js**: Automated breaking point detection
- **capacity-planning.js**: Maximum sustainable load determination

### Component Isolation Tests
- **api-gateway-stress.js**: API gateway specific stress testing
- **database-stress.js**: Database layer stress testing
- **scheduler-engine-stress.js**: Core scheduling algorithm stress testing
- **notification-system-stress.js**: Notification system overload testing

### Failure Mode Analysis
- **cascading-failure.js**: Multi-component failure scenarios
- **resource-contention.js**: Resource competition stress testing
- **deadlock-detection.js**: Database deadlock scenario testing

## Execution Environment

All stress tests are designed to:
- Safely push system limits without data corruption
- Provide detailed metrics on failure points
- Include automatic recovery testing
- Generate actionable capacity planning data

## Safety Measures

- Isolated test environments only
- Automatic test termination on critical failures
- Data backup verification before execution
- Monitoring integration for safety limits
