# Migration Testing Framework

A comprehensive testing framework for validating the FlexTime microservices migration process.

## Framework Components

### 1. Functional Equivalence Testing
- **Purpose**: Ensure new microservices produce identical results to legacy monolith
- **Components**: 
  - Result comparison engines
  - Business logic validation
  - Data integrity verification

### 2. Integration Testing
- **Purpose**: Validate microservice communication and data flow
- **Components**:
  - API contract testing
  - Inter-service communication validation
  - Event-driven workflow testing

### 3. Performance Testing
- **Purpose**: Ensure migration doesn't degrade system performance
- **Components**:
  - Load testing suites
  - Response time validation
  - Resource utilization monitoring

### 4. End-to-End Testing
- **Purpose**: Validate complete user workflows across microservices
- **Components**:
  - Complete user journey testing
  - Cross-service data flow validation
  - Business process continuity

## Getting Started

1. **Setup Test Environment**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run setup:test-env
   ```

2. **Run Migration Validation Suite**
   ```bash
   npm run test:migration-full
   ```

3. **Run Specific Test Categories**
   ```bash
   npm run test:functional-equivalence
   npm run test:integration
   npm run test:performance
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

## Test Categories

### Functional Equivalence Tests
Validate that new microservices produce identical results to legacy system:
- Schedule generation algorithms
- Constraint validation logic
- Team assignment algorithms
- Travel optimization calculations

### Integration Tests
Validate microservice communication:
- API contract compliance
- Event publishing/consumption
- Data consistency across services
- Error handling and recovery

### Performance Tests
Validate system performance:
- Response time benchmarks
- Throughput testing
- Resource utilization
- Scalability validation

### End-to-End Tests
Validate complete workflows:
- Schedule creation workflow
- Team management processes
- Reporting and analytics
- User authentication flows

## Configuration

Test configurations are managed through environment-specific files:
- `config/test.config.js` - Main test configuration
- `config/legacy.config.js` - Legacy system endpoints
- `config/microservices.config.js` - New microservice endpoints
- `config/performance.config.js` - Performance test parameters

## Reporting

The framework generates comprehensive reports:
- Test execution summaries
- Performance benchmarks
- Regression analysis
- Migration readiness assessments
