# Project Cleanup Activities

The following cleanup activities were performed to improve the organization of the FlexTime codebase:

## 1. Removed Context7 MCP Components
- Deleted all `c7_*.js` files that used Context7 as an MCP
- Removed Context7 client implementations
- Updated dependent files to use standard MCP connector
- Disabled Context7-dependent features in the agent factory

## 2. Package.json and Dependency Cleanup
- Removed `build:c7` script
- Removed unused `mongoose` dependency (migrated to Neon DB)
- Updated agent_memory_manager.js to use Neon DB instead of MongoDB
- Removed agent_memory_persistence.js which used MongoDB/Mongoose

## 3. Directory Structure Improvements
- **Test Directories**: Consolidated multiple test directories (`test`, `test-data`, `test-results`, `testing`, `tests`) into a single `/test` directory with proper subdirectories
- **Client Directories**: Renamed for clarity
  - `client` → `ui-components`
  - `clients` → `api-clients`
- **Learning Directories**: Added documentation to clarify the purpose of multiple learning-related directories
- **Documentation**: Consolidated documentation into a central `/docs` directory

## 4. Code Modernization

- Standardized on newer MCP connector implementation
- Updated database models to newer versions
  - Used `db-schedule-updated.js` over `db-schedule.js`
  - Used `db-team-updated.js` over `db-team.js`
- Updated agent factory to use EnhancedMemoryManager

## 5. Added Clarifying Documentation
- Created README files in reorganized directories explaining their purpose
- Added documentation about the multi-directory learning system
- Created a documentation guide in the main `/docs` directory

## Benefits
- More intuitive organization
- Better separation of concerns
- Reduced confusion for new developers
- Easier maintenance
- Cleaner dependencies
