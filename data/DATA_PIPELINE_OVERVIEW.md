# FlexTime Data Processing Pipeline Overview

## Architecture Summary

The FlexTime data processing pipeline has been designed as a comprehensive, enterprise-grade system for handling Big 12 sports scheduling data. The pipeline consists of six major components, each optimized for specific data lifecycle stages.

## Pipeline Components

## Data Flow Architecture

```
External Sources → Ingestion → Processing → Analytics
                                    ↓         ↓
                              ML Pipeline → Exports
                                    ↓         ↓
                                Backup ← Recovery
```

5. **Analysis**: Real-time analytics and ML model training
6. **Distribution**: Automated exports to stakeholders
7. **Protection**: Continuous backup and disaster recovery

### Secondary Flows
- **Real-time Updates**: Live constraint updates bypass full processing

## Security & Compliance

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: At-rest and in-transit encryption
- **Access Control**: Role-based authentication and authorization
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive activity tracking
- **Privacy**: GDPR and FERPA compliance measures

### Backup & Recovery
- **Multiple Locations**: Geographic distribution of backups
- **Automated Testing**: Regular recovery validation
- **Retention Policies**: Compliance-driven data lifecycle
- **Disaster Recovery**: <1 hour RTO for critical systems

## Performance Characteristics

### Throughput
