# Data Processing Pipeline

## Overview
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines for constraint data processing and schedule optimization.

## Directory Structure

### `/etl/`
Core ETL pipeline implementations:
- Data extraction workflows
- Transformation engines
- Loading procedures
- Pipeline orchestration

### `/transformers/`
Data transformation modules:
- Schedule normalization
- Constraint standardization
- Data format conversions
- Business rule applications

### `/validators/`
Data validation and quality assurance:
- Schema validation
- Business rule validation
- Constraint conflict detection
- Data integrity checks

### `/schedulers/`
Pipeline scheduling and orchestration:
- Cron job configurations
- Dependency management
- Pipeline monitoring
- Error recovery workflows

### `/constraints/`
Constraint-specific processing:
- Constraint parsing and normalization
- Conflict resolution algorithms
- Priority weighting systems
- Constraint optimization

### `/pipelines/`
Pre-configured pipeline templates:
- Daily data processing
- Real-time constraint updates
- Schedule generation workflows
- Data synchronization jobs

### `/temp/`
Temporary processing workspace:
- Intermediate data storage
- Processing logs
- Failed record quarantine
- Debug outputs
