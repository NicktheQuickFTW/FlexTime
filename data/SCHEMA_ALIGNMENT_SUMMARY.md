# FlexTime Database Schema Alignment - Completion Summary

## 🎯 **Project Completion: May 30, 2025**

This document summarizes the successful completion of the FlexTime database schema alignment project, which standardized all database references and ID patterns throughout the codebase.

---

## 📋 **Project Overview**

**Initial Problem**: Misalignment between database models expecting `institution_id` and the actual Neon database using `school_id`

**Solution**: Comprehensive schema alignment across 40+ files to match Neon database structure and establish consistent ID patterns

---

## ✅ **Completed Tasks**

### **1. Core Schema Alignment**
- [x] Updated all references from `institution_id` → `school_id`
- [x] Aligned column names (`sport_name` vs `name`, `school` vs `name`)
- [x] Established team ID pattern: `school_id + zero-padded sport_id`
- [x] Established venue ID pattern: `school_id + venue_type` (SSVV format)

### **2. Database Models Updated**
- [x] `/backend/models/db-school.js` - New model for `schools` table
- [x] `/backend/models/db-sport.js` - Updated to use `sport_name` field
- [x] `/backend/models/db-team.js` - Added team ID helper functions
- [x] `/backend/models/db-venue.js` - Added venue ID generation and parsing

### **3. SQL Schema Files Updated**
- [x] `/backend/src/ai/add-football-teams.sql` - Corrected school_id mappings
- [x] `/backend/src/ai/add-football-venues.sql` - Venue ID pattern implementation
- [x] **40+ additional files** - Schema alignment throughout codebase

### **4. Comprehensive Venue Schema Creation**
- [x] **Complete Big 12 Venues Database**: All 16 schools, 10 venue types
- [x] **Football Stadiums**: 16 stadiums with correct capacity data
- [x] **Arenas/Gymnasiums**: Basketball and gymnastics venues
- [x] **Baseball Complexes**: 14 teams (Colorado, Kansas State excluded)
- [x] **Softball Complexes**: 11 teams with proper venue data
- [x] **Soccer Fields**: 16 schools with soccer facilities
- [x] **Volleyball Facilities**: 15 schools (Oklahoma State excluded)
- [x] **Tennis Complexes**: 9 schools with tennis facilities

### **5. Data Directory Organization**
- [x] Created `/data/schemas/` for database schema files
- [x] Created `/data/seed/` for initial data files
- [x] Moved venue schema files to proper locations
- [x] Created comprehensive data directory documentation

### **6. ML Workflow Schema Enhancement**
- [x] Updated ML migrations to use `sport_id` instead of `sport_type`
- [x] Enhanced with FlexTime-specific fields and patterns
- [x] Added comprehensive indexing for performance
- [x] Included triggers for automatic timestamp updates

## 🔢 **ID Pattern Reference**

### **Team ID Pattern**
```
team_id = school_id + zero-padded sport_id
Examples:
- Arizona Baseball: 1 + 01 = 101
- UCF Football: 5 + 08 = 508
- Kansas Basketball: 10 + 02 = 1002
```

### **Venue ID Pattern**
```
venue_id = school_id + venue_type (SSVV format)
Examples:
- Arizona Football Stadium: 01 + 01 = 0101
- UCF Arena: 05 + 02 = 0502
- Kansas Baseball Complex: 10 + 03 = 1003
```

### **Venue Types**
| Code | Type | Sports |
|------|------|--------|
| 01 | Football Stadium | Football |
| 02 | Arena/Gymnasium | Basketball, Gymnastics |
| 03 | Baseball Complex | Baseball |
| 04 | Softball Complex | Softball |
| 05 | Soccer Field | Soccer |
| 06 | Volleyball Facility | Volleyball |
| 07 | Tennis Complex | Tennis |
| 08 | Track & Field | Track Events |
| 09 | Swimming Pool | Swimming & Diving |
| 10 | Golf Course | Golf |

## 📁 **Files Reorganized**

### **Moved to Data Directory**
```
Original Location → New Location
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
backend/src/ai/big12-venues-schema.sql → data/schemas/big12-venues-schema.sql
backend/src/ai/add-football-venues.sql.bak → data/seed/big12-football-venues.sql
