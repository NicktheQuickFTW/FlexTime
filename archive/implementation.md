# HELiiX Intelligence Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the HELiiX Intelligence Engine integration in the FlexTime platform, as specified in the executive briefing and implementation plan.

## 1. Overview

The implementation follows a modular approach to shift complex scheduling intelligence to the Python backend while maintaining the JavaScript agent-based architecture for UI orchestration and user interaction.

## 2. Components Implemented

### HELiiX Intelligence Connector Agent

The HELiiX Intelligence Connector Agent serves as the bridge between the JavaScript agent system and the Python backend. It:

- Delegates complex computational tasks to the backend
- Handles asynchronous task management
- Formats responses for agent-to-agent communication
- Provides fallback to local computation when the backend is unavailable
- Integrates with the learning loop architecture

- `/backend/agents/heliix_connector/heliix_intelligence_connector_agent.js`: Main connector agent implementation
- `/backend/agents/heliix_connector/index.js`: Module exports
- `/backend/agents/heliix_connector/README.md`: Documentation

### Agent Factory Integration

The Agent Factory has been updated to support the HELiiX Intelligence Connector:

- Added configuration options for enabling the Intelligence Engine
- Added support for creating and managing the connector agent
- Integrated the connector into the agent lifecycle

**Files:**
- `/backend/agents/core/agent_factory.js`: Updated with Intelligence Connector support

### Main Module Integration

The main agents module has been updated to expose the HELiiX Connector:

**Files:**
- `/backend/agents/index.js`: Updated exports to include the connector

### Testing

A test script has been created to demonstrate the connector's functionality:

**Files:**
- `/backend/scripts/test-heliix-connector.js`: Test script for the Intelligence Connector

## 3. Features Implemented

### Task Delegation

The Intelligence Connector can delegate tasks to the Python backend using the following task types:
- `generate_schedule`: Generate optimized schedules
- `optimize_schedule`: Optimize existing schedules
- `validate_schedule`: Validate schedules against constraints
- `select_algorithm`: Select appropriate algorithms for scheduling
- `analyze_constraints`: Analyze constraints for conflicts
- `resolve_conflicts`: Resolve conflicts in schedules

### Learning Loop Integration

The connector integrates with the learning loop architecture:
- Stores user feedback in the Intelligence Engine
- Stores experiences for analysis
- Retrieves recommendations based on learned patterns

### Asynchronous Task Management

For long-running tasks, the connector provides:
- Asynchronous task submission
- Task status monitoring
- Result retrieval when tasks complete

## 4. Python Intelligence Engine

The HELiiX Intelligence Engine is a Python-based backend that provides advanced computational capabilities for the FlexTime platform. It communicates with the JavaScript agent system through a REST API, allowing for a clear separation of concerns between the user interface orchestration and the heavy computational work.

### 4.1 Components Implemented

#### API Layer

The API layer provides RESTful endpoints for communication with the JavaScript agent system:

- `GET /api/status` - Get the status of the Intelligence Engine
- `POST /api/agents/tasks` - Submit a task to the Intelligence Engine
- `GET /api/agents/tasks/:taskId` - Get the status of a task
- `GET /api/agents/tasks/:taskId/result` - Get the result of a completed task
- `POST /api/feedback` - Store feedback data
- `POST /api/experiences` - Store experience data
- `GET /api/recommendations/scheduling` - Get scheduling recommendations
- `GET /api/recommendations/learning` - Get learning recommendations

#### Machine Learning API

The ML API provides endpoints for accessing machine learning capabilities:

- `POST /api/ml/patterns` - Extract patterns from schedule, feedback, or experience data
- `GET /api/ml/recommend` - Get parameter recommendations based on extracted patterns
- `GET /api/ml/models` - List all available ML models with metadata
- `POST /api/ml/predict/game` - Predict the outcome of a game with confidence scores
- `POST /api/ml/predict/schedule` - Predict the quality of a schedule
- `POST /api/ml/predict/team` - Predict the COMPASS index for a team
- `POST /api/ml/train` - Train a model with the provided data

#### Core Components

The core components include base classes, utilities, and shared functionality:

- Task management system
- Asynchronous job processing
- Error handling and logging

#### Scheduling Services

The scheduling services provide algorithms for generating and optimizing sports schedules:

- Schedule generation algorithms
  - Round-robin generator
  - Basketball schedule generator
  - Football schedule generator
- Schedule validation and metrics calculation

#### Knowledge Graph

The knowledge graph provides a structured representation of domain knowledge:

- Entity relationships (teams, venues, constraints)
- Rule-based reasoning
- Domain-specific queries for scheduling

- `INTELLIGENCE_ENGINE_API_KEY`: API key for authenticating with the Intelligence Engine

## 6. Usage Example

```javascript
const { heliixConnector } = require('../agents').agents;

// Create the connector agent
const intelligenceConnector = heliixConnector.createIntelligenceConnectorAgent({
  intelligence: {
    serviceUrl: process.env.INTELLIGENCE_ENGINE_URL,
    apiKey: process.env.INTELLIGENCE_ENGINE_API_KEY,
    enabled: true
  }
});

// Initialize the agent
await intelligenceConnector.initialize();

// Delegate a task to the Intelligence Engine
const delegateTask = intelligenceConnector.createTask(
  'delegate',
  'Generate optimized basketball schedule',
  {
    task: {
      taskType: 'generate_schedule',
      parameters: {
        sportType: 'basketball',
        teams: teams,
        constraints: constraints,
        options: {
          season: '2024-2025',
          optimizationLevel: 'high'
        }
      }
    },
    options: {
      wait: true,
      responseFormat: 'agent',
      timeout: 120000
    }
  }

// Submit the task
const result = await intelligenceConnector.submitTask(delegateTask);
console.log('Schedule generation result:', result);
```
