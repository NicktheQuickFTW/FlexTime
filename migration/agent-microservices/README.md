# FlexTime Agent-to-Microservices Transformation

## Overview

This directory contains the complete transformation of FlexTime's multi-agent system into containerized microservices. The migration maintains agent intelligence while enabling distributed deployment, horizontal scaling, and modern DevOps practices.

## Architecture Transformation

### Current Agent System
- Monolithic agent orchestration in single Node.js process
- Direct function calls between agents
- Shared memory and state management
- Single point of failure

### Target Microservices Architecture

- Event-driven communication via message brokers
- Distributed state management with data consistency
- High availability and horizontal scaling
