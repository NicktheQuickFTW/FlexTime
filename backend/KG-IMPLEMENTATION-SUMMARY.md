# Knowledge Graph Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the Knowledge Graph components that have been implemented in the FlexTime Intelligence Engine.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Base Knowledge Graph

A flexible graph database foundation that:
- Represents domain entities (teams, venues, constraints, etc.)
- Manages relationships between entities
- Provides query capabilities for traversing relationships
- Supports searching by entity type and properties
- Enables path finding between entities

### 2. Scheduling Knowledge Graph

A domain-specific extension of the base graph with:
- Specialized entity types for teams, venues, and constraints
- Helper methods for common scheduling operations
- Dedicated relationship types for scheduling concepts
- Domain-specific query capabilities

### 3. Schedule Knowledge Enhancer

A system that enhances the knowledge graph with intelligence from:
- Schedule analysis using pattern extraction
- Feedback data analysis
- Experience data integration
- Parameter optimization insights
- Algorithm selection recommendations

### 4. Knowledge Graph API

RESTful API endpoints exposing all knowledge graph functionality:
- Graph status and statistics
- Entity and relationship management
- Graph enhancement from various data sources
- Scheduling insight queries
- Path queries and entity searches

## Integration with Machine Learning

The Knowledge Graph has been fully integrated with the Machine Learning components:

1. **Pattern Integration**: Patterns extracted by the ML Pattern Extractor are used to create insight entities in the graph, establishing relationships between scheduling concepts and their optimal parameters.

2. **Insight Enrichment**: The graph stores and organizes insights about:
   - Optimal team workloads
   - Home/away balance preferences
   - Game day frequency patterns
   - Consecutive game streaks
   - Algorithm selection based on problem characteristics

3. **Parameter Optimization**: The graph provides optimized parameters for:
   - Schedule generation tasks
   - Algorithm selection
   - Constraint weighting
   - Team-specific preferences

## Knowledge Entity Types

The implementation includes specialized entity types:
- `team` - Team entities with associated properties and relationships
- `venue` - Venue entities with capacity and availability
- `constraint` - Constraints that apply to teams or venues
- `task_type` - Types of scheduling tasks (generation, optimization)
- `algorithm` - Algorithm entities with parameter preferences
- Various insight entities representing ML-derived knowledge

## Technical Details

### Entity Structure

```python
class Entity:
    """Represents an entity in the knowledge graph."""
    
    def __init__(self, entity_id: str, entity_type: str, properties: Dict[str, Any] = None):
        self.entity_id = entity_id
        self.entity_type = entity_type
        self.properties = properties or {}
        self.relationships = {}  # Maps relationship type to a set of target entity IDs
```

### Schedule Knowledge Enhancer

```python
class ScheduleKnowledgeEnhancer:
    """Enhances the scheduling knowledge graph with ML-driven insights."""
    
    def __init__(self, graph: SchedulingKnowledgeGraph = None, pattern_extractor: PatternExtractor = None):
        self.graph = graph or SchedulingKnowledgeGraph()
        self.pattern_extractor = pattern_extractor or PatternExtractor()
        
    def enhance_from_schedule(self, schedule: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Enhance the knowledge graph with insights from a schedule."""
        # Extract patterns from the schedule
        patterns = self.pattern_extractor.extract_patterns_from_schedule(schedule)
        
        # Create entities and relationships from patterns
        # ...
```

## API Endpoints

The Knowledge Graph is accessed through the following API endpoints:

- `GET /api/kg/status` - Graph status and statistics
- `POST /api/kg/enhance/schedule` - Enhance with schedule data
- `POST /api/kg/enhance/feedback` - Enhance with feedback data
- `POST /api/kg/enhance/experiences` - Enhance with experience data
- `GET /api/kg/insights` - Query scheduling insights
- `POST /api/kg/entity` - Create entities
- `GET /api/kg/entity/<entity_id>` - Retrieve entities
- `POST /api/kg/relationship` - Create relationships
- `POST /api/kg/query` - Query entities
- `POST /api/kg/path` - Find paths

## Future Enhancements

Potential enhancements for the Knowledge Graph components include:

1. **Persistent Storage**: Adding database-backed storage for the graph
2. **Advanced Reasoning**: Implementing inference rules for deriving new knowledge
3. **Constraint Propagation**: Automatically propagating constraints through the graph
4. **Visualization Tools**: Creating visual representations of the knowledge graph
5. **Schema Enforcement**: Adding schema validation for entities and relationships
6. **Semantic Search**: Adding natural language querying capabilities
