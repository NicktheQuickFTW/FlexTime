# FlexTime Integration Services

This directory contains services that integrate with external systems and APIs. These services provide standardized interfaces for interacting with third-party platforms.

## Integration Services

- `perplexityResearchService.js`: Integration with Perplexity AI for research capabilities
- `geminiResearchService.js`: Integration with Google's Gemini AI for advanced research
- `virtualAssistantService.js`: Integration with voice and conversational AI platforms

## Purpose

Integration services encapsulate the complexity of external system interactions, providing:

1. **Abstraction**: Clean interfaces that hide implementation details
2. **Error Handling**: Standardized error management for external dependencies
3. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against API quota exhaustion
4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when external services are unavailable

## Development Conventions

When adding new integration services:

1. Implement proper error handling and retry logic
2. Use environment variables for all API keys and endpoints
3. Provide mock/test implementations for development environments
4. Document rate limits and quotas in service comments
5. Follow the naming convention: `platformNameService.js`

For more details on integration patterns, refer to the [Integration Architecture](../../../../development/infrastructure-enhancement/docs/technical_architecture.md) section of the technical documentation.
