- **Knowledge Querying** - Enables complex queries across the domain model

### 4. Enhanced Conflict Resolution System

A sophisticated conflict resolution system has been implemented:

- **Conflict Analyzer** - Identifies and categorizes scheduling conflicts
- **Conflict Visualizer** - Creates visual representations of conflicts
- **Resolution Plan Generator** - Creates step-by-step plans to resolve conflicts
- **Automatic Conflict Resolution** - Automatically applies resolutions where possible
- **Conflict Resolution API** - Provides RESTful access to conflict resolution capabilities

### 5. Comprehensive Feedback Collection UI Components

A comprehensive feedback system has been implemented:

- **Feedback Submission** - Collects structured feedback about schedules
- **Feedback Templates** - Enables creation of custom feedback templates
- **Feedback Analysis** - Analyzes collected feedback for insights
- **Feedback Categories** - Organizes feedback into logical categories
- **Feedback Collection API** - Provides RESTful access to feedback functionality

## API Integration

All components are accessible through a unified API:

- `GET /api/status` - System status and capabilities
- `POST /api/agents/tasks` - Task submission to agents
- `POST /api/ml/predict/game` - Game outcome prediction
- `POST /api/kg/enhance/schedule` - Knowledge graph enhancement
- `POST /api/conflict/analyze` - Schedule conflict analysis
- `POST /api/feedback/submit` - Feedback submission

## Implementation Status

| Component | Status | Feature Count | API Endpoint Count |
|-----------|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Director Agents | ✅ Complete | 8 agent types, 15+ capabilities | 5 endpoints |
| Machine Learning | ✅ Complete | 3 models, pattern extraction | 7 endpoints |
| Knowledge Graph | ✅ Complete | Entity and relationship management | 10 endpoints |
| Conflict Resolution | ✅ Complete | 9 conflict types, visualization | 5 endpoints |
| Feedback Collection | ✅ Complete | Templates, categories, analysis | 8 endpoints |

## Technical Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture:

1. **JavaScript Agent Layer** - Provides flexibility and user interaction
2. **Python Intelligence Engine** - Handles complex computational tasks
3. **API Bridge** - Connects the JS and Python layers
4. **Data Layer** - Manages persistent storage (in-memory for now, database-ready)

## Integration Flow

The components integrate as follows:

1. **User Interaction** → JavaScript Agent Layer
2. **Task Delegation** → Director Agents
3. **Schedule Generation** → Specialized Agents + ML Components
4. **Conflict Detection** → Conflict Resolution System
5. **Knowledge Enhancement** → Knowledge Graph + ML Insights
6. **Feedback Processing** → Feedback Collection + Knowledge Graph

## Key Achievements

1. **Modular Design** - Each component is self-contained but integrates seamlessly
2. **API-First Approach** - All functionality exposed through consistent APIs
3. **Machine Learning Integration** - ML capabilities enhance all aspects of the system
4. **Knowledge-Driven** - Knowledge graph provides context for intelligent decisions
5. **Conflict Management** - Advanced conflict detection and resolution
6. **User Feedback Loop** - Complete system for collecting and analyzing feedback

## Future Enhancements

While all required components have been implemented, some future enhancements could include:

1. **Database Integration** - Replace in-memory storage with persistent database
2. **Advanced Visualization** - Enhanced visual representations of schedules and conflicts
3. **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket support for real-time notifications
4. **Mobile Support** - Native mobile interfaces for feedback collection
5. **Advanced ML Models** - More sophisticated predictive models for scheduling
