- Soft-warning highlights for potential issues
- Regional game clustering optimization

### Postseason Insights
- NET/RPI projection capabilities
- "Postseason Score" metric per scenario
- Historical performance data integration
- Competitive balance considerations

### Manual Adjustments
- Drag-and-drop interface for schedule modifications
- Instant validation of changes
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Conflict detection and resolution

### Notifications & Collaboration
- In-app notification inbox
- WebSocket push notifications
- Email integration
- Preference center for notification settings
- Batching capabilities for notifications

### Import/Export Capabilities
- CSV template support
- Asynchronous export processing
- Multiple export formats (CSV, PDF, ICS)
- API feed for integration with other systems
- 24-hour rollback capability

## Technical Requirements

### System Architecture
- Multi-agent architecture with specialized agents
- Microservices topology with clear service boundaries
- Event-driven communication via message broker
- Kubernetes deployment with autoscaling
- Comprehensive observability stack

### Agent Structure
- Master Director agent for orchestration

- State machine implementation for workflow management
- Progress emission for real-time updates

### Data Management
- PostgreSQL for primary data storage
- Analytics replica for reporting
- Redis for queuing and caching
- S3 for file storage and exports
- Row-level security for multi-tenant isolation

### Integration Requirements
- WebSocket gateway for live updates
- RESTful API with Swagger documentation
- SSO integration capabilities
- Calendar system integration (Google Calendar, Outlook)
- Webhook support for external notifications

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: Schedule generation in ≤ 5 minutes
- Scalability: Support for concurrent users during peak scheduling periods
- Security: Row-level security, audit logging, MFA
- Reliability: Circuit breaker patterns, dead letter queues
- Observability: Prometheus/Grafana, ELK stack, Jaeger (OTEL)

## Design Constraints
- Black and white color scheme for all visual elements
- Big 12 logo displayed in black and white
- Multi-agent architecture for specialized task handling
- Completion deadline of August 2025

## Future Considerations
- In-season rescheduling for emergencies
- Continuous model tuning via MLflow/DVC
- IP whitelisting and idempotency keys
- Mobile companion app
- Attendance and revenue prediction
- Distributed computing for multi-sport joint scheduling

This analysis serves as the foundation for the detailed functional specification, technical architecture, UI/UX design, and development roadmap deliverables.
