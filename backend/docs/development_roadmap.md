3. **Data Volume**: Large datasets may impact system performance
   - Mitigation: Database optimization, caching strategies, pagination

4. **User Adoption**: Complex features may present learning curve
   - Mitigation: Intuitive UI design, comprehensive training, in-app guidance

5. **Timeline Pressure**: August 2025 deadline leaves limited buffer
   - Mitigation: Phased approach, MVP definition, prioritized backlog
