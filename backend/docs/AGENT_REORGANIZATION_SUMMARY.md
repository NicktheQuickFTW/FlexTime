# FlexTime Agent and Service Reorganization

**Completion Date:** May 29, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… Complete  

## Overview

This document summarizes the reorganization of the FlexTime agent system and services to improve code organization, maintainability, and alignment with architectural principles.

## Implemented Changes

### 1. Agent System Organization

Created a standardized structure for the agent system:

```
/backend/src/ai/agents/
  /directors/           # Manager/coordinator agents
    master_director_agent.js
    parallel_scheduling_agent.js
  /workers/             # Specialized worker agents
    constraint_management_agent.js
    schedule_optimization_agent.js
  /orchestrators/       # Multi-agent orchestrators
    multiSportResearchOrchestrator.js
    parallelResearchOrchestrator.js
```

### 2. Service Organization

Reorganized services by their role in the system:

```
/backend/services/
  /core/                # Core business services
    advanced_scheduling_service.js
  /integration/         # External system integrations
    perplexityResearchService.js
    geminiResearchService.js
    virtualAssistantService.js
```

### 3. Documentation

Added comprehensive documentation:

- README.md files in each directory explaining its purpose
- Clear guidelines for maintaining the separation between agents and services
- Explanation of agent categories and responsibilities

## Agent-Service Distinction

This reorganization clarifies the distinction between:

- **Agents**: Autonomous components that make decisions, collaborate, and maintain state
- **Services**: Functional components that respond to requests and provide specific capabilities

## Alignment with Architecture

This reorganization aligns with the FlexTime architectural principles:

1. **Microservices-Based**: Services are organized by their functional domain
2. **Multi-Agent System**: Agents are organized by their role in the agent system
3. **Standardized Controllers**: Clear separation between controllers, services, and agents
4. **Phased Scaling Approach**: Services are positioned for progressive enhancement

## Maintenance Guidelines

When adding new components:

1. **New Agents**: Add to the appropriate subdirectory under `/backend/src/ai/agents/`
2. **New Services**: Add to the appropriate subdirectory under `/backend/services/`
3. **Documentation**: Update README.md files with information about new components
4. **Consistency**: Follow established naming conventions and design patterns

This reorganization is part of the ongoing effort to improve the FlexTime codebase organization and maintainability, following the same consolidation approach applied to controllers, configuration files, and documentation.
