## 📈 Calculation Method

### Formula Breakdown

```
Overall COMPASS Rating = 
  (C × 0.25) + (O × 0.20) + (M × 0.15) + 
  (P × 0.15) + (A × 0.10) + (S1 × 0.10) + (S2 × 0.05)

Where:
- C = Competitive Performance Score (0-100)
- O = Operational Excellence Score (0-100)
- M = Market & Media Score (0-100)
- P = Player Experience Score (0-100)
- A = Audience & Attendance Score (0-100)
- S1 = Sport Standing Score (0-100)
- S2 = Sustainability Score (0-100)
```

### Sub-Component Calculations

Each main component may have sub-components:

**Competitive Performance (C) breakdown:**
```
C = (Win% × 0.30) + (Championships × 0.25) + (Rankings × 0.25) + 
    (Quality Wins × 0.10) + (Bad Losses × -0.10) + (Consistency × 0.10)
```

**Operational Excellence (O) breakdown:**
```
O = (Coaching × 0.35) + (Facilities × 0.30) + (Academic Success × 0.20) + 
    (Program Management × 0.15)
```

## 📋 Rating Guidelines

### When to use plus/minus grades:
- **Plus (+)**: Exceeds most criteria for the grade level
- **Standard**: Meets the criteria solidly
- **Minus (-)**: Barely meets criteria, concerning trends

### Red Flags that lower ratings:
- NCAA violations or investigations
- Academic probation (APR issues)
- Coaching scandals
- Financial instability
- Facility safety issues
- Mass transfers
- Fan violence/issues

### Bonus factors that raise ratings:
- Recent championships
- Iconic coaches
- Historic venues
- Rivalry dominance
- Olympic athletes produced
- Academic excellence
- Community engagement

## 🔄 Update Frequency & Volatility Management

### Update Schedule
- **Daily updates**: Win/loss, injuries, major news (±0-2 points)
- **Weekly updates**: Full competitive metrics, rankings (±0-5 points)
- **Monthly updates**: Recruiting, transfers, operational changes (±2-10 points)
- **Seasonal review**: Complete recalibration (±5-20 points)
- **Annual calibration**: Historical adjustment, peer comparison

### Volatility Controls

**Dampening Formula:**
```
New Rating = (Current Rating × 0.8) + (Calculated Change × 0.2)
```

This prevents knee-jerk reactions to single events.

**Maximum Daily Change Limits:**
- Regular season game: ±2 points
- Major upset/loss: ±3 points
- Championship/disaster: ±5 points
- Multiple events stack with diminishing returns

**Historical Weighting:**
```
Season Rating = 
  40% Current Season + 
  30% Previous Season + 
  20% Two Seasons Ago + 
  10% Three Seasons Ago
```

### Confidence Indicators

Each rating includes confidence levels:
- **High Confidence** (±2 points): Stable program, consistent performance
- **Medium Confidence** (±5 points): Some volatility, transition period
- **Low Confidence** (±10 points): Major changes, limited data

Example:
```json
{
  "team": "Kansas Basketball",
  "rating": 95,
  "confidence": "high",
  "variance": ±2,
  "trend": "stable",
  "lastMajorChange": "2023-03-15"

## 🔮 Future Considerations

### NCAA Settlement Revenue Sharing Impact (Post-2025)
**Note for future COMPASS updates**: The NCAA settlement requiring revenue sharing will need to be factored into ratings:

- **A4 Schools** (Power 4) must opt-in to ~$20M+ annual revenue sharing
- **Impact by Conference**:
  - **Big 10/SEC**: Minimal impact due to massive media deals
  - **ACC/Big 12**: Significant strain, will force sport prioritization
  - **G5/Non-Revenue Share**: Major competitive disadvantage
  
- **Rating Adjustments Needed**:
  - Schools investing in specific sports should see rating boosts
  - Non-priority sports at budget-constrained schools may see significant drops
  - "Sustainability" component will become more critical
  - May need new "Financial Investment" sub-component
  
- **Example Scenarios**:
  - Big 12 school prioritizes Football/Basketball: +5-10 points for those sports, -10-15 for others
  - G5 school opts out entirely: -15-20 points across all sports due to talent drain

This will fundamentally reshape competitive balance and must be incorporated when the settlement takes effect.
