# Agent Training and Testing System

This system provides a comprehensive framework for training, testing, and continuously improving the FlexTime agent ecosystem. It enables systematic measurement of agent performance, autonomous learning from past experiences, and ongoing optimization to enhance accuracy, efficiency, and overall effectiveness.

## Architecture Overview

The training system consists of four main components:

1. **Test Harness**: Runs controlled experiments with agents under various conditions
2. **Simulation Engine**: Creates realistic scenarios to evaluate agent behavior
3. **Evaluation Framework**: Measures agent performance across multiple dimensions
4. **Optimization System**: Tunes agents based on evaluation results

These components work together in a continuous improvement cycle to systematically enhance agent capabilities over time.

## Key Components

### Test Harness

The test harness provides a controlled environment for running agent tests:

- **Isolated Testing**: Executes agent tasks in a sandboxed environment
- **Parallel Execution**: Runs multiple test cases simultaneously
- **Reproducible Results**: Ensures consistent testing conditions
- **Error Handling**: Captures and analyzes agent failure modes
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks resource usage and timing metrics

### Simulation Engine

The simulation engine creates realistic scenarios to evaluate agent behavior:

- **Scenario Generation**: Creates diverse test cases from real-world data
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Adjusts complexity to target specific challenge levels
- **Temporal Dynamics**: Simulates time-based effects and constraints
- **Stakeholder Modeling**: Mimics behavior of external stakeholders
- **Error Injection**: Introduces realistic edge cases and failure modes

### Evaluation Framework

The evaluation framework measures agent performance across multiple dimensions:

- **Multi-Metric Analysis**: Assesses accuracy, efficiency, robustness, and more
- **Baseline Comparison**: Compares performance against established baselines
- **Scoring and Grading**: Assigns numerical scores and letter grades based on performance
- **Historical Tracking**: Maintains evaluation history to track agent improvement
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates comprehensive reports with per-metric breakdowns

The framework evaluates agents on these key metrics:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Accuracy | How accurately the agent completes tasks and handles data |
| Efficiency | Response time and resource utilization efficiency |
| Robustness | Ability to handle errors, edge cases, and recover from failures |
| Responsiveness | Speed and consistency of agent responses |
| Resource Usage | CPU and memory consumption efficiency |
| Reliability | Consistency and dependability of agent operations |
| Complexity | Ability to handle tasks of varying complexity levels |

### Optimization System

The optimization system tunes agents based on evaluation results:

- **Multiple Optimization Strategies**: Supports various approaches including incremental, Bayesian, genetic, and reinforcement learning
- **Parameter Optimization**: Tunes numerical and categorical parameters to improve specific metrics
- **Strategy Optimization**: Switches between different agent strategies based on performance
- **Improvement Estimation**: Estimates the potential impact of each optimization change
- **Agent-Type Specific Schemas**: Uses specialized schemas for different agent types
- **Historical Tracking**: Maintains a history of optimization changes and their impacts

Optimization targets include:

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Parameters | Numerical and categorical configuration values that affect agent behavior |
| Strategies | High-level algorithmic approaches that agents use to solve problems |
| Schemas | Data structures and models that agents use to interpret information |

## Usage

The training system can be used in several modes:

### Continuous Improvement Pipeline

```javascript
const { TrainingPipeline } = require('./agents/training');

// Create pipeline with all agents
const pipeline = new TrainingPipeline({
  agents: agentSystem.getAllAgents(),
  testSets: ['basic', 'advanced', 'edge_cases'],
  evaluationMetrics: ['accuracy', 'efficiency', 'robustness'],
  optimizationTargets: ['parameters', 'strategies']
});

// Run continuous improvement cycle
await pipeline.runContinuousImprovement({
  cycles: 5,
  parallelTests: 4,
  reportFrequency: 'cycle'
});
```

### Targeted Agent Testing

```javascript
const { TestHarness } = require('./agents/training/test_harness');

// Test a specific agent with focused test cases
const testHarness = new TestHarness({
  verbose: true,
  saveResults: true
});

const results = await testHarness.testAgent(
  schedulingDirector,
  'scheduling_complexity',
  {
    testCases: 25,
    difficulty: 'challenging'
  }
);

console.log(results.summary);
```

### Performance Evaluation

```javascript
const { EvaluationFramework } = require('./agents/training/evaluation');

// Evaluate agent performance
const evaluator = new EvaluationFramework({
  metrics: ['accuracy', 'efficiency', 'robustness'],
  baselineComparison: true
});

const evaluationResult = await evaluator.evaluateResults(
  agentId,
  testResults,
  {
    metrics: ['accuracy', 'efficiency', 'robustness'],
    compareToBaseline: true
  }
);

console.log(`Overall Score: ${evaluationResult.score} (${evaluationResult.grade})`);
console.log('Metric breakdown:', evaluationResult.summary);
```

### Agent Optimization

```javascript
const { OptimizationSystem } = require('./agents/training/optimization');

// Optimize agent based on evaluation results
const optimizer = new OptimizationSystem({
  targets: ['parameters', 'strategies'],
  strategy: 'incremental',
  learningRate: 0.1
});

const optimizationResult = await optimizer.optimizeAgent(
  agent,
  evaluationResults,
  {
    targets: ['parameters', 'strategies'],
    strategy: 'incremental',
    applyChanges: true
  }
);

console.log(`Estimated improvement: ${optimizationResult.improvement.toFixed(2)}%`);
console.log('Changes applied:', optimizationResult.summary);
```
