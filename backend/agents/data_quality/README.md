# Data Quality Agent

The Data Quality Agent is responsible for ensuring the integrity, completeness, and consistency of data throughout the FlexTime scheduling pipeline.

## Purpose

The Data Quality Agent addresses a critical gap in the scheduling workflow by:

1. **Validating Input Data**: Ensuring all data entering the system meets required standards
2. **Detecting Inconsistencies**: Identifying and flagging contradictions or anomalies
3. **Standardizing Information**: Applying consistent formatting and normalization
4. **Filling Missing Metadata**: Using inference to complete partial data sets
5. **Maintaining Data Lineage**: Tracking data provenance and transformation history

## Architecture

The Data Quality Agent operates as a specialized agent in the FlexTime platform, extending the base Agent class and integrating with the core agent communication system.

### Key Components

- **DataQualityAgent**: Core agent responsible for orchestrating data quality operations
- **ValidationEngine**: Rules-based system for validating data against defined schemas
- **ConsistencyChecker**: Component that identifies contradictions across related data
- **DataEnricher**: System for inferring and adding missing metadata
- **QualityReport**: Detailed report on data quality metrics and issues

### Integration Points

- **Database Layer**: Direct access to system databases for validation and remediation
- **Agent System**: Integration with the FlexTime agent communication system
- **API Endpoints**: Quality-check endpoints for external data submissions
- **Event Hooks**: Pre-processing and post-processing hooks throughout data lifecycle

## Features

### Preventive Validation

The agent applies rules-based validation to prevent bad data from entering the system in the first place. This includes:

- Type checking (string, number, date, enum)
- Range validation (min/max values, date ranges)
- Referential integrity (foreign key validity)
- Format validation (patterns, regular expressions)
- Business rule validation (sport-specific rules)

### Proactive Monitoring

Beyond validation, the agent continuously monitors the system for quality issues:

- Scheduled data audits across all data domains
- Real-time monitoring of data operations
- Anomaly detection using statistical methods
- Consistency checks across related data sets

### Automated Remediation

When issues are detected, the agent can take automated remediation actions:

- Self-healing for common data problems
- Standardization of inconsistent representations
- Inference of missing values based on context
- Generation of correction proposals for human review

### Reporting and Analytics

The agent provides comprehensive insights into data quality:

- Quality score metrics across data domains
- Trend analysis of quality issues over time
- Root cause analysis for recurring problems
- Recommendations for process improvements

## Use Cases

### Schedule Generation Pre-flight Checks

Before schedule generation begins, the Data Quality Agent validates:
- Team information completeness
- Venue availability accuracy
- Constraint logical consistency
- Historical data correctness

### Continuous Data Monitoring

During normal operation, the agent performs:
- Daily data quality audits
- Real-time validation of data changes
- Detection of drift in reference data
- Identification of stale or outdated information

### Integration Testing

During system updates, the agent assists with:
- Validating test data sets
- Checking data migration correctness
- Verifying schema compliance
- Testing business rule enforcement

## Implementation

The Data Quality Agent is implemented as a core component of the FlexTime platform, with hooks throughout the data lifecycle to ensure quality at every stage.

```javascript
const { DataQualityAgent } = require('./agents/data_quality');

// Initialize with system configuration
const dataQualityAgent = new DataQualityAgent({
  validationRules: './config/validation_rules.json',
  remediationStrategies: './config/remediation_strategies.json',
  alertThresholds: {
    warning: 90,
    error: 75,
    critical: 60
  },
  auditSchedule: '0 0 * * *' // Daily at midnight
});

// Register with agent system
agentSystem.registerAgent(dataQualityAgent);

// Start monitoring
await dataQualityAgent.startMonitoring();
```
