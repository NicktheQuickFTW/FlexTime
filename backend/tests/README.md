# Testing Framework

This directory contains all testing-related resources for the FlexTime backend:

- `integration-tests/`: Tests that validate the integration between different components
- `unit-tests/`: Tests for individual components and modules
- `data/`: Test data used for running tests
- `results/`: Directory for storing test output and results

## Test Consolidation

Previously, testing resources were spread across multiple directories:
- `test/`
- `test-data/`
- `test-results/`
- `testing/`
- `tests/`

These have been consolidated into this single directory structure for better organization.
