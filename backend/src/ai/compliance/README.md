# Compliance Agent

The Compliance Agent is responsible for ensuring that all schedules in the FlexTime system adhere to conference and NCAA regulations, preventing costly violations while automating the complex process of compliance checking.

## Purpose

The Compliance Agent addresses critical regulatory concerns by:

1. **Tracking Rule Changes**: Maintaining an up-to-date database of conference and NCAA regulations
2. **Validating Schedules**: Checking generated schedules against all applicable rules
3. **Flagging Violations**: Identifying and reporting any non-compliant elements
4. **Recommending Alternatives**: Suggesting compliant modifications when violations are detected
5. **Documenting Decisions**: Creating audit trails for compliance-related decisions

## Architecture

The Compliance Agent operates as a specialized agent in the FlexTime system, integrating with the scheduling pipeline to provide real-time compliance validation.

### Key Components

- **ComplianceAgent**: Core agent responsible for orchestrating compliance operations
- **RuleEngine**: Rules-based system for encoding and evaluating compliance rules
- **RuleRepository**: Database of current NCAA, conference, and institution-specific rules
- **ComplianceValidator**: System that applies rules to schedule instances
- **ViolationResolver**: Component that generates compliant alternatives

### Integration Points

- **Scheduling Pipeline**: Pre and post-validation hooks for schedule generation
- **Agent System**: Integration with the FlexTime agent communication system
- **External APIs**: Connections to official NCAA and conference rule repositories
- **Reporting System**: Integration with audit and documentation systems

## Features

### Comprehensive Rule Management

The agent maintains a complete repository of compliance rules:

- NCAA Division I, II, and III regulations
- Conference-specific scheduling requirements
- Institution-specific policies
- Sport-specific regulations (basketball, football, etc.)
- Academic calendar constraints

### Real-time Compliance Checking

During schedule generation, the agent provides:

- Pre-optimization constraint validation
- Post-generation comprehensive compliance checking
- Real-time feedback on regulatory concerns
- Severity classification of potential violations

### Violation Resolution

When non-compliance is detected, the agent:

- Identifies the specific rule being violated
- Assesses the severity and potential consequences
- Recommends minimal changes to achieve compliance
- Explains the rationale behind the violation and recommendation

### Compliance Documentation

For audit and governance purposes, the agent:

- Documents all compliance checks performed
- Records any violations detected and their resolution
- Maintains a detailed history of rule interpretations
- Generates compliance certification reports

## Use Cases

### Pre-generation Rule Configuration

Before schedule generation begins:
- Loads applicable rules based on sport, conference, and division
- Configures rule parameters according to current season
- Validates that constraints don't inherently violate regulations
- Sets up appropriate compliance monitoring

### Schedule Validation

During and after schedule generation:
- Checks each game against applicable playing rules
- Validates season structure (pre-season, conference, post-season)
- Verifies compliance with rest and travel regulations
- Ensures academic calendar requirements are met

### Compliance Reporting

For governance and documentation:
- Generates compliance certificates for completed schedules
- Provides detailed reports of rule applications
- Documents any exceptions or special circumstances
- Creates audit-ready explanation of compliance decisions

## Implementation

The Compliance Agent is implemented as a core component of the FlexTime platform, closely integrated with the scheduling process to ensure all schedules meet regulatory requirements.

```javascript
const { ComplianceAgent } = require('./agents/compliance');

// Initialize with appropriate rule sources
const complianceAgent = new ComplianceAgent({
  ruleSourcesConfig: {
    ncaa: {
      apiKey: process.env.NCAA_RULES_API_KEY,
      refreshInterval: '7 days'
    },
    conferences: {
      sources: [
        { name: 'Big12', source: 'https://big12.com/api/rules', apiKey: process.env.BIG12_API_KEY },
        { name: 'SEC', source: './data/conference_rules/sec.json' },
        // Additional conferences...
      ]
    },
    institutionRules: './data/institution_policies/'
  },
  complianceReporting: {
    generateReports: true,
    reportDestination: './compliance_reports/',
    notificationEmail: 'compliance@university.edu'
  }
});

// Register with agent system
agentSystem.registerAgent(complianceAgent);

// Start the compliance agent
await complianceAgent.start();
```
