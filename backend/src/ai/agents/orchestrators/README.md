# FlexTime Orchestrator Agents

This directory contains orchestrator agents that manage complex workflows across multiple services in the FlexTime system. Orchestrators coordinate research and processing tasks, often involving parallel operations.

## Orchestrator Agents

- `multiSportResearchOrchestrator.js`: Manages research activities across multiple sports simultaneously
- `parallelResearchOrchestrator.js`: Coordinates parallel research tasks for improved performance

## Responsibilities

Orchestrator agents are responsible for:

1. **Workflow Management**: Designing and executing complex multi-step workflows
2. **Parallelization**: Distributing tasks across worker instances for performance
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Optimizing resource usage for large-scale operations
4. **Results Aggregation**: Combining results from multiple parallel operations
5. **Error Recovery**: Handling failures in individual tasks without compromising the entire workflow

## Implementation Notes

Orchestrator agents typically:

- Maintain job queues and track progress
- Implement strategies for efficient task distribution
- Handle batching of similar operations
- Provide progress monitoring and reporting
