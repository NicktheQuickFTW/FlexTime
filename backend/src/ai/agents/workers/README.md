# FlexTime Worker Agents

This directory contains specialized worker agents that perform specific tasks within the FlexTime system. Worker agents handle focused aspects of the scheduling problem.

## Worker Agents

- `constraint_management_agent.js`: Specialized agent for handling constraint validation and enforcement
- `schedule_optimization_agent.js`: Agent responsible for optimizing schedules based on various criteria

## Responsibilities

Worker agents are responsible for:

1. **Specialization**: Focusing on a specific aspect of the scheduling problem
2. **Task Execution**: Performing well-defined operations with measurable outcomes
3. **Domain Expertise**: Implementing specialized algorithms for their specific domain
4. **Reporting**: Providing detailed information about their operations
5. **Self-improvement**: Learning from past operations to improve future performance

## Implementation Notes

Worker agents typically:

- Accept clearly defined inputs and produce specific outputs
- Operate within boundaries set by director agents
- Implement specialized algorithms for their domain
- May use machine learning to improve over time
