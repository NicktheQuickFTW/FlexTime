# Stakeholder Communication Agent

The Stakeholder Communication Agent is responsible for managing all communication related to scheduling changes with teams, television networks, venues, and other stakeholders. It streamlines coordination and ensures all parties stay informed throughout the scheduling process.

## Purpose

The Stakeholder Communication Agent addresses critical communication needs by:

1. **Notification Management**: Generating and sending timely notifications about schedule changes
2. **Response Tracking**: Monitoring stakeholder responses and acknowledgments
3. **Escalation Handling**: Identifying unresolved issues and escalating when necessary
4. **Communication History**: Maintaining a complete record of all scheduling communications
5. **Preference Management**: Tracking stakeholder preferences for future scheduling considerations

## Architecture

The Stakeholder Communication Agent operates as a specialized agent in the FlexTime system, managing the complex web of communication required for successful schedule coordination.

### Key Components

- **CommunicationAgent**: Core agent responsible for orchestrating all stakeholder interactions
- **NotificationEngine**: System for generating and delivering notifications through multiple channels
- **ResponseTracker**: Component that monitors and processes stakeholder responses
- **EscalationManager**: System for handling unresolved issues and time-sensitive matters
- **StakeholderRepository**: Database of stakeholders, their contact information, and preferences

### Integration Points

- **Scheduling Pipeline**: Hooks into schedule creation, modification, and finalization processes
- **Agent System**: Integration with the FlexTime agent communication system
- **External Communication**: Email, SMS, and API integrations with stakeholder systems
- **Calendar Systems**: Integration with scheduling and calendar applications
- **CRM Systems**: Connection to customer relationship management systems

## Features

### Multi-channel Communication

The agent manages communications across multiple channels:

- Email notifications with appropriate formatting and attachments
- SMS alerts for time-sensitive communications
- API-based integration with stakeholder systems
- Web portal notifications and updates
- Calendar invitations and updates

### Intelligent Notification Management

For effective communication, the agent:

- Prioritizes communications based on urgency and importance
- Customizes message content for different stakeholder types
- Batches non-urgent updates to prevent notification fatigue
- Times communications appropriately for different time zones
- Uses templates with dynamic content for consistency

### Response Tracking and Resolution

To ensure closed-loop communication, the agent:

- Tracks acknowledgments and responses from stakeholders
- Sends appropriate reminders for pending responses
- Escalates unresolved matters based on configurable thresholds
- Notifies human operators when intervention is required
- Documents resolution outcomes for future reference

### Stakeholder Relationship Management

For improved long-term scheduling coordination:

- Maintains a profile of each stakeholder's preferences and constraints
- Tracks historical communication patterns and response times
- Records special requests and considerations for future scheduling
- Manages opt-in/opt-out preferences for different notification types
- Analyzes stakeholder satisfaction metrics

## Use Cases

### Schedule Change Notifications

When schedule changes occur:
- Identifies all affected stakeholders (teams, venues, broadcasters)
- Generates appropriate notifications with specific details
- Prioritizes time-sensitive changes that require immediate attention
- Provides relevant context about why changes were necessary

### Approval Workflows

For changes requiring approvals:
- Initiates multi-stakeholder approval processes
- Tracks responses and approval status
- Sends reminders for pending approvals
- Consolidates responses for scheduling decision-makers

### Broadcasting Coordination

For television and media coordination:
- Manages communication with TV networks for game selection
- Coordinates broadcasting windows and time constraints
- Handles special requests for marquee matchups
- Confirms technical requirements for venues

### Venue Communications

For facility and operations management:
- Coordinates with venue operators for availability confirmation
- Communicates setup requirements and special needs
- Manages communications about facility constraints
- Handles conflict resolution when venue issues arise

## Implementation

The Stakeholder Communication Agent is implemented as a core component of the FlexTime platform, managing the complex web of communications required for successful athletic scheduling.

```javascript
const { StakeholderCommunicationAgent } = require('./agents/stakeholder_communication');

// Initialize with communication settings and stakeholder information
const communicationAgent = new StakeholderCommunicationAgent({
  communicationChannels: {

      apiKey: process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY,
      defaultSender: 'scheduling@university.edu'

    urgencyClassifiers: './config/urgency_rules.json'
  },
  templates: {
