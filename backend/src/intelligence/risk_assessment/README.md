# Risk Assessment Agent

The Risk Assessment Agent is responsible for anticipating potential disruptions to athletic schedules and suggesting contingency plans. It improves operational resilience by monitoring external factors such as weather, travel conditions, and other risks that could impact scheduled events.

## Purpose

The Risk Assessment Agent addresses operational risk factors by:

1. **Weather Monitoring**: Tracking weather forecasts for all scheduled event locations
2. **Travel Risk Analysis**: Identifying potential transportation disruptions
3. **Facility Assessment**: Monitoring venue availability and condition issues
4. **Historical Pattern Analysis**: Learning from past disruptions to predict future risks
5. **Contingency Planning**: Developing and recommending backup plans for high-risk situations

## Architecture

The Risk Assessment Agent operates as a specialized agent in the FlexTime system, continuously monitoring potential risk factors and providing actionable intelligence to mitigate scheduling disruptions.

### Key Components

- **RiskAssessmentAgent**: Core agent responsible for orchestrating risk monitoring and response
- **WeatherMonitor**: System for tracking weather forecasts at event locations
- **TravelDisruptionDetector**: Component for identifying transportation risks
- **VenueStatusTracker**: System for monitoring facility conditions and availability
- **ContingencyPlanner**: Engine for generating and evaluating backup options

### Integration Points

- **Weather APIs**: Integration with weather forecasting services
- **Travel Systems**: Connections to transportation status services
- **Venue Management**: Integration with facility management systems
- **Agent System**: Integration with the FlexTime agent communication system
- **Notification System**: Connection to the stakeholder communication system

## Features

### Comprehensive Risk Monitoring

The agent conducts multi-factor risk analysis:

- Short and long-range weather forecasting for all event locations
- Transportation system status (airports, highways, rail)
- Venue maintenance schedules and condition reports
- Regional event conflicts and resource contention
- Health and safety alerts from relevant authorities

### Predictive Risk Assessment

For proactive disruption management, the agent:

- Evaluates probability of disruption based on multiple factors
- Assesses severity of potential impact on schedules
- Identifies time-sensitivity of required decisions
- Calculates confidence levels for different risk projections
- Learns from historical patterns to improve predictions

### Contingency Generation

When risks are identified, the agent:

- Develops multiple contingency options based on scenario
- Evaluates feasibility of each contingency plan
- Ranks alternatives based on impact, cost, and implementation difficulty
- Initiates preliminary preparations when warranted
- Automates contingency activation when thresholds are reached

### Risk Communication

For effective operational response, the agent:

- Generates tiered alerts based on risk severity
- Provides visualization of risk factors and timelines
- Updates stakeholders as risk profiles change
- Documents risk management decisions and outcomes
- Creates post-event analysis for continuous improvement

## Use Cases

### Pre-Season Risk Mapping

Before the season begins:
- Analyzes historical weather patterns for all venues and dates
- Identifies high-risk travel corridors based on historical data
- Maps contingency venues and alternative transportation options
- Creates baseline risk profiles for different schedule scenarios

### In-Season Monitoring

Throughout the season, the agent:
- Continuously monitors weather forecasts for upcoming events
- Tracks transportation system status for team travel routes
- Monitors venue maintenance and condition reports
- Alerts when risk thresholds are crossed

### Event-Specific Risk Assessment

For individual scheduled events:
- Provides 10-day risk outlook with daily updates
- Assesses multi-factor risk score (weather, travel, venue)
- Recommends specific preparedness actions
- Initiates contingency protocols when necessary

### Post-Disruption Analysis

After a disruption occurs:
- Documents actual impact versus predicted impact
- Analyzes effectiveness of contingency measures
- Updates risk models based on new data
- Recommends process improvements for future seasons

## Implementation

The Risk Assessment Agent is implemented as a proactive component of the FlexTime platform, constantly monitoring for factors that could disrupt scheduled events.
