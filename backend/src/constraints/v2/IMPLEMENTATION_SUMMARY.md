## 🚀 Quick Start Integration

```typescript
// 1. Import the new system
import { createConstraintSystem } from './constraints/v2';

// 2. Initialize with configuration
const constraintSystem = createConstraintSystem({
  engine: { profile: 'balanced' },
  ml: { enableAutoOptimization: true },
  monitor: { enableRealTime: true }
});

// 3. Start using immediately
const result = await constraintSystem.evaluateSchedule(schedule, constraints);
```
