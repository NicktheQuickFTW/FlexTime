# HELiiX Intelligence Engine Implementation Status

## Completed Implementation

We have successfully implemented the core components of the HELiiX Intelligence Engine:

### 1. API Layer
- Created the Flask application with the following endpoints:
  - `GET /api/status` - Get engine status
  - `POST /api/agents/tasks` - Submit tasks
  - `GET /api/agents/tasks/:taskId` - Get task status
  - `GET /api/agents/tasks/:taskId/result` - Get task results
  - `POST /api/feedback` - Store feedback
  - `POST /api/experiences` - Store experiences
  - `GET /api/recommendations/scheduling` - Get scheduling recommendations
  - `GET /api/recommendations/learning` - Get learning recommendations

### 2. Core Components
- Implemented the `TaskManager` for task creation, scheduling, and execution
- Created task registry for mapping task types to handler functions
- Added support for asynchronous task processing with worker threads

### 3. Scheduling Services
- Implemented the `ScheduleGenerator` for creating schedules:
  - `RoundRobinGenerator` for generic round-robin schedules
  - `BasketballScheduleGenerator` for basketball-specific schedules
  - `FootballScheduleGenerator` for football-specific schedules

### 4. Knowledge Graph
- Created the `KnowledgeGraph` for representing domain knowledge
- Implemented specialized `SchedulingKnowledgeGraph` for the scheduling domain
- Added support for entities, relationships, and queries specific to scheduling

### 5. Configuration and Setup
- Created requirements.txt for dependencies
- Added Dockerfile for containerization
- Implemented run.py for starting the server

## Next Development Tasks

The following components still need to be implemented:

### 1. Optimization Services
- Implement optimization algorithms:
  - Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solver
  - Simulated Annealing
  - Genetic Algorithms
- Create sport-specific optimizers:
  - Basketball schedule optimizer
  - Football schedule optimizer
- Add constraint satisfaction logic

### 2. Machine Learning Services
- Implement pattern extraction from historical data
- Create predictive models for game outcomes
- Develop continuous learning from feedback
- Build COMPASS Index calculation

### 3. Advanced Knowledge Graph Features
- Implement automated knowledge extraction
- Add semantic reasoning capabilities
- Create integration with external knowledge sources

### 4. Testing Framework
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for the API layer
- Performance benchmarks for optimization algorithms

### 5. Documentation
- API documentation
- Developer guides
- Example usage scenarios

## Integration with JavaScript Agents

The Python Intelligence Engine integrates with the JavaScript agent system through the HELiiX Intelligence Connector Agent. We have successfully implemented:

1. The JavaScript connector agent that communicates with the Python backend
2. The Python API that receives and processes requests from the connector
3. A basic task delegation pattern for scheduling operations
4. Feedback and experience storage for continuous learning

## Running the Implementation

To run the Python Intelligence Engine:

```bash
# Navigate to the Intelligence Engine directory
cd python/intelligence_engine

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the server
python run.py
```

To test the integration with the JavaScript connector:

```bash
# In the backend directory
node scripts/run-intelligence-engine.js
```

## Deployment Options

The Python Intelligence Engine can be deployed in several ways:

1. **Standalone Server**: Run directly with Python
2. **Docker Container**: Build and run using the provided Dockerfile
3. **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy to cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP

## Upcoming Milestones

1. Complete the optimization services - Target: June 2025
2. Implement the machine learning services - Target: July 2025
3. Enhance the knowledge graph features - Target: July 2025
4. Develop comprehensive testing framework - Target: August 2025
