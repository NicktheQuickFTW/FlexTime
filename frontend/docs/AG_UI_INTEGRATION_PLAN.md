# AG-UI Integration Plan for FlexTime

## Overview
Integrate AG-UI protocol to enhance FlexTime's intelligent scheduling system with real-time agent-user interactions, streaming updates, and human-in-the-loop decision making.

## Integration Phases

### Phase 1: Core AG-UI Setup
- [ ] Install AG-UI TypeScript SDK packages
- [ ] Set up AG-UI client in FlexTime frontend
- [ ] Configure HTTP agent connections to backend
- [ ] Implement basic event streaming

### Phase 2: Agent Integration
- [ ] Connect FlexTime's Director Agents to AG-UI
- [ ] Implement schedule optimization streaming
- [ ] Add conflict resolution with human input
- [ ] Set up travel optimization progress updates

### Phase 3: Enhanced UI Components
- [ ] Create AG-UI powered schedule builder
- [ ] Add real-time optimization visualizations
- [ ] Implement interactive conflict resolution
- [ ] Build agent status dashboard

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Multi-agent coordination display
- [ ] Predictive state updates
- [ ] Tool-based generative UI for schedules
- [ ] Human-in-the-loop workflow orchestration

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components
```typescript
// AG-UI React Components
- AgentScheduleBuilder
- OptimizationProgressStream
- ConflictResolutionDialog
- AgentStatusMonitor
```

### Backend Agent Events
```typescript
// AG-UI Event Types for FlexTime
- schedule_optimization_started
- constraint_conflict_detected
- travel_route_optimized
- human_input_required
- schedule_generated
```

### Benefits for FlexTime
1. **Real-time feedback** during schedule generation
2. **Interactive decision making** for complex conflicts
3. **Transparent AI processes** with streaming updates
4. **Enhanced user experience** with responsive agents
5. **Scalable architecture** for multiple agent types

## Next Steps
1. Review AG-UI TypeScript SDK structure
2. Install core AG-UI packages
3. Create initial agent connection
4. Build first interactive component

This integration will transform FlexTime from a static scheduling tool into a dynamic, AI-powered collaborative platform for Big 12 athletic scheduling.
