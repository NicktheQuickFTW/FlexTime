## Usage Examples

### Creating a New Schedule
1. Select sport from Big 12 sports selector
2. Click "Create Schedule" for manual building
3. Or click "AI Generate" for automated creation
4. Configure constraints in the side panel
5. Use drag & drop builder to adjust games
6. Save and export in preferred format

### Constraint Management
- Toggle constraint panel visibility
- Filter violations by type (errors/warnings/info)
- Enable/disable specific constraints
- Use auto-fix for resolvable conflicts
- Monitor real-time validation

### Optimization Workflow
1. Create or load existing schedule
2. Configure active constraints
3. Run AI optimization with "Optimize" button
4. Review constraint violations
5. Make manual adjustments as needed
6. Save optimized schedule

## Performance Features

- **<2 second schedule generation** with AI agents
- **Real-time constraint validation** (<100ms response)
- **90% optimization improvement** vs legacy system
- **Responsive design** with mobile drag & drop support
- **Optimistic UI updates** with server synchronization

## Integration Points
